# Karsten Beck React 19 Frontend SPA

This app provides the Fizz Buzz React SPA that works with the FizzBuzzGame.API .NET Web API.

There are no tests for this app as I'm unfamiliar with testing in React. The individual components have comments, that 
explain the functionality. 

The app uses Chakra UI for styling and react router for navigation. It is a vite built.
